# Ender-5-Pro-Files

This is my archive of files for the Creality Ender 5 Pro. At the moment, that primarily means my Cura 3D printing profiles. In the future, I may add profiles for other slicers. or mods that I make to the printer.

All my final releases will go into this repository, so be sure to keep checking back for updates - and I will be updating the Cura files as I keep printing, testing and tweaking.

## Cura Profiles

Currently, there is only one file and this is the main Cura profile for the Ender 5 Pro. There is a work in progress to update and perfect the profile so stay tuned. 

- [Download the profile for Cura](https://github.com/iollama/Ender-5-Pro-Files/blob/main/Ender5pro_cura_iollama_DirectDrive_20201228.curaprofile)

So that you don't have to risk making typos by manually typing out the start and end G-code, here are a pair of text files that you can just copy+paste straight into Cura. These are for the Snapmaker 2 (***don't*** try to use these with the original Snapmaker).

- [Ender 5 Pro Start G-code](https://github.com/iollama/Ender-5-Pro-Files/blob/main/ender-5-pro-start-code.txt)
- [Ender 5 Pro End G-code](https://github.com/iollama/Ender-5-Pro-Files/blob/main/ender-5-pro-end-code.txt)

The spesific printer that I am using has a Direct Drive Mod (highly recommeded) by [Hangtight](https://bit.ly/35ffR6v) and you may need to increase retention if you are using the vanilla Ender 5 pro
